# Fibonacci Value
- First I generate the controller that will have the method that will return the value of the fibonacci series according to the given index.
- I generate an interface that has the method to obtain the fibonacci value (AppInterfacesFibonacciInterface.php).
- I generate the class where the method to obtain the fibonacci value will be implemented (App\Services\Fibonacci.php).
- I use a while loop to obtain the expected fibonacci value.
- I import the Interface to the controller
- I use the implemented method to get the value and return it in the endpoint.
- I generate the Route to use the endpoint in the routes/web.php file.
